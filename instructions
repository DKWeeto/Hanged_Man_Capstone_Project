Run the "Hanged_Man.py" file and follow the input instructions to choose a category.
See the blank spaces to view the generated movie or character.
If the (e.g.) movie title includes numbers, a reminder to guess numbers will be given.
Input a letter (or number), and you will see if your guess is correct.
Once you guess an incorrect character, an image of the Hanged Man will begin generating, and will build with each incorrect guess.
You must guess one letter at a time until the full word is completed.
Good luck!
